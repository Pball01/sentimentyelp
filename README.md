# Yelp Restaurant Reviews Sentiment Analysis

In the world of the internet, customers tend to research and analyze reviews before deciding which restaurant to visit. For businesses, it’s hard for them to gauge customer satisfaction, as customer’s prefer providing reviews online and due to the large prevalence of the Internet, the
number of reviews can sometimes be unfathomable for a business to review individually, especially from websites like Yelp.
Reviews are a vital source of feedback loop that the business utilizes to stay current and heed to the customer suggestions, which can attract an even larger customer base. This can lead to higher profit for the business and help them grow. For this project, we have analyzed Yelp reviews of restaurants and find out the factors that are leading to positive and negative views. We have then performed different classification techniques to train the model to predict if a review is positive or negative. Finally we have deployed the model using Flask.


## How to deploy the model on your computer:
Go to https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset to download the business and review datasets. Create a new folder on your desktop and name it Yelp_Project. Download all files from here and include the kaggle datasets in the same folder. 

Open terminal and execute the following command:

	> cd Yelp_Project
	> python app.py
	
Once the code is executed go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ on your browser
